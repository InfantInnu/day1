    <!-- blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
 -->

 <!--HTTP1.1
     HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer
     and a local or remote web server. In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server
      by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client. 
    
    eg. GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
          Host: www.example.com-->

<!-- HTTP2
    HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page 
    load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. -->




    <!-- A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as 
        a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary 
        JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the 
        characteristics of the object. We can access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:objectName.propertyName
        
Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = ‘Ford’;
myCar.model = ‘Mustang’;
myCar.year = 1969; -->
